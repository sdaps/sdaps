What to do when things go wrong
===============================

In general, you can try to adjust the magic values in defs.py to improve
recognition and work around errors that you get. If you need to change
something, pĺease drop us a line.

Matrix could not be recognized
------------------------------

This means SDAPS could not find all four edge markers.

Please have a look at the following:
 * Check that the scan is OK.
   * Does it have black/white lines? This can happen in the scanner is not
     clean.
   * Check that the resolution is set to 300dpi
   * Check there is no black line at one side
 * Try modifying the magic recognition parameters in defs.py
   image_line_width and image_line_coverage. However, it is unlikely
   that this is neccessary.

Recognition quality is bad
--------------------------

Load a lot of images into the project, then run
  $ sdaps project_dir boxgallery
Now look at the PDF file and find threshold values that work well for you.
Set the correct "checkbox_checked" and "checkbox_corrected" coverages for
you in defs.py.


Text boxes are recognized even though they are empty
----------------------------------------------------

This can happen because of dirt on the page or because the scanner is not
very accurate and the outline is detected as writing.

If dirt is detected, try to adjust the textbox_scan_* values in defs.py.

If the outline is detected than probably something worst is going on. You
can adjust the textbox_*_padding values, or adjusting the image_line_*
values might also help (as these are used to find the corners of the
textbox).

If the above does not help
==========================

Mail the authors :-)
It may be neccessary to have all the data to help. So if you can try to
always provide examples where things fail.
