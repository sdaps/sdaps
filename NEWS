Overview of Changes in SDAPS 1.1.3
==================================

With this release SDAPS has been restructured internally. There are two
reasons for doing this. The first is to improve the API which
simplifies the usage of it in custom scripts. Another point is that
the old code was incompatible with the import handling of python 3. So
doing this change is also a prerequisite for a future port to python 3.x.

Other changes include:
 * GUI: Fix an offset error with new GTK+ versions
 * GUI: Improved keyboard navigation (issue #30)
 * GUI: Improved mouse handling and overlay drawing
 * GUI: Show the questionnaire ID on the right side
 * GUI: Sort images by page number
 * LaTeX: Improved unicode support
 * LaTeX: Fixed precision issues in report generation
 * LaTeX: Fixed some whitespace issues in the LaTeX class
 * ODT: When stamping a single document, keep forms intact
 * reorder: Fix reordering of simplex documents
 * recognize: Slight changes in the OMR heuristics.
 * Fixed issues in the upgrade routine

Overview of Changes in SDAPS 1.1.2
==================================

This release brings a lot of small improvements, but also some new features.
The main new feature is the addition of a "convert" module, which can be used
to convert non-monochrome scans into monochrome images for later processing.
This module is also able to apply 3D-transformations as they are neccessary
when the source image was done using a camera.
This new module requires OpenCV. Note that using a feed scanner is still
prefered to this method.

Other changes include:
 * LaTeX: Fix compilation of large documents (by suppressing position output)
 * LaTeX: Fix multicolumn items and cline at the start of choicequestions
 * ODT: Custom styling in answers and question is now possible.
 * Various improvements and fixes in the corner mark detection code
 * New "custom" style which can be used when customizing the behaviour of SDAPS
 * A PDF with annotations will now be created if there was an error during setup
 * An issue in the base dir search code that affected OSX has been fixed
