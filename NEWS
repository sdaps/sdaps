===================================

Important changes:
 * New LaTeX class fixing compatibility and other issues
 * Delete image files on reset
 * Fix an issue after resetting a project
 * Export checkbox data separately for single choice questions
 * Export invalid single choice responses using strings (in new projects)
 * Change logging to be 1 based for pages (rather than 0)
 * Permit modifying the corner mark positions

New and updated languages:
 * German
 * Russian
 * Swedish
 * Spanish
 * Portuguese (Brazil)
 * Polish
 * Portuguese
 * Italian
 * Chinese (Simplified)
 * French


Overview of Changes in SDAPS 1.9.9
==================================

Please note that the system LaTeX files will be used preferentially from
now on. However, upstream TeX Live has a bug and sdapscode128.tex is
installed to the wrong directory, making the class unusable.

As such, distributions should continue to use the LaTeX files provided in
this bundle (pass --build-tex/--install-tex). Alternatively, it is also
possible to fix the install location of the mentioned file.

Another important change is that the command line arguments have been
restructed. The aim here is to make all commands more consistent by
grouping them based on their purpose. Some commands have become more
verbose or the order of arguments has changed.

Important changes:
 * LaTeX files are only installed when requested now (#200)
 * Create export, import, setup and report command groups (#210)
 * Add pandas based intermediate export helper (#4)
 * Add feather data export (requires pyarrows)
 * Accept UTF-8 in LaTeX metadata file (#208)
 * Fix incorrect notifications causing a GUI failure (#211)

New and updated languages:
 * Spanish
 * French

Overview of Changes in SDAPS 1.9.8
==================================

This release breaks backward compatibility in a few small ways. For example
the "style" parameter of the LaTeX class was renamed to "sdaps_style".

Also unrelated to this release but still noteworthy is that the LaTeX class
has been uploaded to CTAN and has also been added to TeX Live. There will
be a few more related changes to this so that SDAPS will pick up the system
version of the LaTeX class by default.

Important changes:
 * LaTeX: Class now takes sdaps_style as argumen instead of style
 * LaTeX: Class will now always report the correct page count (#192)
 * LaTeX: Improve spacing of multiline choicequestion items
 * LaTeX: Disable header repetition in rangearray/markgroup questions (#21)
 * Fix issue with SQL schema (#189)
 * Fix issues with transformation matrix calculation (#195)
 * Allow adjusting corner marks in GUI (#194)
 * Allow running box recognition from GUI


Overview of Changes in SDAPS 1.9.7
==================================

This is a smaller bugfix release mostly to solve compatibility issues with
older SDAPS versions.

Important changes:
 * Slightly improved command line parsing
 * Fix various data format migration issues (#173, #175)
 * Fix the reset and reorder commands to work again (#168)
 * Update LaTeX class with a few minor fixes

New and updated languages:
 * Portuguese

Overview of Changes in SDAPS 1.9.6
==================================

This is the next release to stabilize SDAPS in the run up to a 2.0 release.
There are a number of smaller changes that change behaviour, so again, take
some care when upgrading.

Important changes:
 * Allow adding review comments on whole sheets and questions (#148)
 * Allow specifying the LaTeX engine used to compile the project (#150)
 * Reorder CSV command parameters to match new layout
 * Fix printing of state when an error occurs during setup (#163)
 * Fix LaTeX class build script hanging when l3build is missing (#166, #153)
 * Default to not align all group environments in a document (sdaps-class#15)
 * Allow disabling all recognition related markings (sdaps-class#14)
 * Add basic support for reading QR codes as part of questions (#2)

New and updated languages:
 * Norwegian Bokmål
 * Portuguese
 * Portuguese (Brazil)

Overview of Changes in SDAPS 1.9.5
==================================

WARNING: This release breaks compatibility in a number of different ways,
please be careful when upgrading.

The most important change is that the command line argument order has been
changed. The SDAPS command that is to be run is now the first argument, and
the project directory is second.

There have also been a number of changes to the LaTeX class, including new
instruction texts that have not yet been translated to all languages.

Important changes:
 * Rework command line handling
 * Default instructions for filling out the form are updated
 * Margin handling in LaTeX class is improved
 * "info" environment padding at the top of the page is improved
 * Improved rotated header layouter for array question types

New and updated languages:
 * Korean
 * Dutch
 * Norwegian Bokmål
 * French
 * German

Overview of Changes in SDAPS 1.9.4
==================================

Important changes:
 * Ensure box IDs are unique (#142)
 * Fix variable name handling of the single choice questions (#141)
 * Make "verified" a property of each image, all images need to be marked as verified
 * Add support for right to left languages:
   - Implement RTL switching in LaTeX
   - Make metadata file line numbered
   - Fix anotation line length (and indentation for RTL languages)
   - Rework choicequestion layout

New and updated languages:
 * Romanian
 * Sinhala
 * Spanish

Overview of Changes in SDAPS 1.9.3
==================================

This is a bugfix release.

Important changes:
 * Fix TEXINPUTS environment variable handling (issue #120)
 * convert: Improve DPI selection and detection for PDF conversion
 * latex: Improved whitespace in rangearray with alternative choices
 * latex: Handle \ior_get_str:NN deprecation
 * latex: Fix single choice question metadata export

New and updated languages:
 * Polish

Overview of Changes in SDAPS 1.9.2
==================================

This is a new unstable release porting SDAPS to Python 3 and modifying the
data storage format. This release is incompatible to any prior release.
It can be considered the first 2.0 alpha release though.

Important changes:
 * ODT support has been dropped entirely
   (due to missing dependencies for Python 3)
 * Data storage has been switched to sqlite storing json serialised objects
 * Correctly calculate standard deviation (issue #111)
 * Updated LaTeX class with new features and fixes
   - Documentation improvements
   - Add \qid back for querying the current questionnaire ID (Paulo Matias)
   - Requires variable handling and auto numbering
   - Add range specification to choicegroup questions only showing certain choices
   - Improved layouting of sdapsarray
   - Allow setting checkbox count of singlemark questions
 * Add a few helpers for packaging

New and updated languages:
 * Norwegian bokmål
 * Spanish
 * Italian
 * Ukrainian

Overview of Changes in SDAPS 1.9.1
==================================

This is a new unstable release pulling in a lot of fixes. Please note that
it is incompatible to the previous 1.9.0 release as the fixes to the class
will result in the survey IDs to become different.

Important changes:
 * Fix repetition of questionnaires
 * Fixes to make class work with TeXlive 2017-08-08
 * Fix build to not install the TeX class in the users home directory
 * Fix LaTeX report generation (#108)
 * Fixes and tests of CSV import and exporter
 * Improve CSV export to include more information about sheets
 * Change default style to QR code

Overview of Changes in SDAPS 1.9.0
==================================

Beta release that includes the new class. Generating a new project will now
need to use the sdapsclassic class to work fine.

Please see http://sdaps.org/class-doc and https://github.com/sdaps/sdaps-class
for some more information.

Overview of Changes in SDAPS 1.1.11
===================================

Mostly a bugfix release again. The most important fix (preventing dataloss) is
that the data is now written atomically. This means that aborting an SDAPS run
should not result in a corrupted database anymore.

Important changes:
 * model: Write survey file atomically (#79)
 * image: compatibility with older glib versions
 * csv: Import code fixes (#79)
 * latex: Work around manual enumeration breaking automatic numbering
 * setup: Create nested directories instead of only one leve
 * convert: Support landscape questionnaires (#88)

New and updated languages:
 * Arabic

Overview of Changes in SDAPS 1.1.10
===================================

Again, mostly a bugfix release. One thing to note is that if you are using
small fields (i.e. choiceitemtext) is that single characters/digits can
sometimes be detected as only dirty. So if you want to use fields with only
a single character, then it is likely a good idea to fine tune the minimum
size of writing and other aspects of freeform field recognition.

Important changes:
 * latex: Fix search paths (#63)
 * latex report: Fix formatting issues
 * gui: Fix broken display in some corner cases (#67)
 * gui: Ensure dialogs are on top of the main window (#66)
 * csv: Options to export recognition quality
 * Allow filtering based on string replacements for freeform fields (#69)
 * latex: Fix encoding issues for some special characters (#70)
 * latex: Allow smaller choiceitemtext elements (#68)

New and updated languages:
 * French
 * German
 * Portuguese (Brazil)
 * Dutch

Overview of Changes in SDAPS 1.1.9
==================================

Mostly a bugfix release.

Important changes:
 * csv: PNG export for complete questions
 * Fix various encoding issues (#59, #61)
 * dynamic kfill size for barcode detection
 * Fix LaTeX search path regression (see #11)

New and updated languages:
 * Spanish

Overview of Changes in SDAPS 1.1.8
==================================

Important changes:
 * recognize: prevent division by zero error
 * recognize: try barcode detection both with and without kfill
 * recognize: ignore data from previous run
 * csv: Add support to specify delimiter
 * csv, ids: allow output to any file including stdout
 * gui: properly escape all strings

New and updated languages:
 * German

Overview of Changes in SDAPS 1.1.7
==================================

The most important change in this release is that the
import of image data has been simplified.

SDAPS can now do an image format conversion automatically
as part of the "add" command, removing the necessity of
using "convert" or some other external method to preprocess
the images. As before, this feature requires OpenCV.

Another change is that SDAPS now imports PDF files
directly. If a PDF file contains a full page image
(i.e. a scanned document) then this image is used
directly to prevent image quality loss due to resampling.
This feature requires poppler to be installed.

Overall these changes make it a lot easier to work with
different scanners. It is now only neccessary to
pass the "--convert" option to the "add" command to
add files that are not already in the expected format.

Important changes:
 * stamp: Fix re-stamping all IDs
 * add: Implement conversion feature (--convert option)
 * convert: Add support for reading PDF files

New and updated languages:
 * German
 * Portuguese (Brazil)


Overview of Changes in SDAPS 1.1.6
==================================

This release adds support to use QR code instead of Code-128. The
main advantage is that QR-Code contains redundancy so that recognition
should be more reliable even with bad scans.
Another important change is that it is now possible to select different
modes for checkbox detection without modifying the source code. This
should simplify the usage of SDAPS in certain cases.

Feedback for optimizing the different modes is of course welcome. The
thresholds have not been tested extensively.

Important changes:
 * Support for QR-Code based IDs has been added ("qr" style)
 * csv export: Allow export of freeform textboxes as images
 * Updated example and testcase for newer multicol versions
 * tex: Fix writing sdaps file for all macros.
 * Allow selection of different checkbox detection modes.

New and updated languages:
 * Portoguese (copy of Portoguese (Brazil))
 * German

Overview of Changes in SDAPS 1.1.5
==================================

Important changes:
 * report: Fix import of PIL (Florian Rinke)
 * odt: Fix annotation on setup failure
 * gui: Fix memory leak
 * latex: Small improvements to class usability
 * translations: Fix LaTeX dictionary names.

New and updated languages:
 * Finnish
 * German

Overview of Changes in SDAPS 1.1.4
==================================

This is mostly a bugfix and translations release, as there was still some
fallout from the refactoring done in the last release. Thanks to everyone
who submitted patches to fix these!

Important changes:
 * dependency, build, and import fixes (#44, #46, and more)
 * fix layout changes in LaTeX and example (introduced in 1.1.2)
 * report: fix non A4 paper sizes (issue #41)

New and updated languages:
 * Portuguese (Brazil)
 * Spanish
 * German

Overview of Changes in SDAPS 1.1.3
==================================

With this release SDAPS has been restructured internally. There are two
reasons for doing this. The first is to improve the API which
simplifies the usage of it in custom scripts. Another point is that
the old code was incompatible with the import handling of python 3. So
doing this change is also a prerequisite for a future port to python 3.x.

Other changes include:
 * GUI: Fix an offset error with new GTK+ versions
 * GUI: Improved keyboard navigation (issue #30)
 * GUI: Improved mouse handling and overlay drawing
 * GUI: Show the questionnaire ID on the right side
 * GUI: Sort images by page number
 * LaTeX: Improved unicode support
 * LaTeX: Fixed precision issues in report generation
 * LaTeX: Fixed some whitespace issues in the LaTeX class
 * ODT: When stamping a single document, keep forms intact
 * reorder: Fix reordering of simplex documents
 * recognize: Slight changes in the OMR heuristics.
 * Fixed issues in the upgrade routine


New and updated translations:
 * German
 * Spanish

Overview of Changes in SDAPS 1.1.2
==================================

This release brings a lot of small improvements, but also some new features.
The main new feature is the addition of a "convert" module, which can be used
to convert non-monochrome scans into monochrome images for later processing.
This module is also able to apply 3D-transformations as they are neccessary
when the source image was done using a camera.
This new module requires OpenCV. Note that using a feed scanner is still
prefered to this method.

Other changes include:
 * LaTeX: Fix compilation of large documents (by suppressing position output)
 * LaTeX: Fix multicolumn items and cline at the start of choicequestions
 * ODT: Custom styling in answers and question is now possible.
 * Various improvements and fixes in the corner mark detection code
 * New "custom" style which can be used when customizing the behaviour of SDAPS
 * A PDF with annotations will now be created if there was an error during setup
 * An issue in the base dir search code that affected OSX has been fixed

New and updated translations:
 * Arabic

Overview of Changes in SDAPS 1.1.1
==================================

Important changes:
 * Fix the "min coverage" heuristic
 * Export text as UTF-8 in CSV files (issue #23)
 * report: Ignore empty sheets
 * Add "verified" and "recognized" flags for sheets. Recognition will
   not be done by default if either flag is set.
 * GUI: Pressing "Enter" now sets the "verified" flag
 * LaTeX class: Paint inner area of boxes white. This is required to allow
   background coloring.

And a couple more small bugfixes and additions.

New and updated translations:
 * German
 * Dutch

Overview of Changes in SDAPS 1.1.0
==================================

This release brings a lot of new goodies. As a development release it may
still be a bit rough in a few places, but everyone is invited to play with it
and report any issues :-)

Important changes:
 * Support for duplex scanning of simplex questionnaires (issue #1)
 * Freeform fields can be manually replaced with text (issue #14)
 * Mark questions can now have an arbitrary checkbox count (issue #7)
 * Correctly pick new questionnaire IDs during stamp (issue #22)
 * Report paper size is now locale dependend (issue #9)
 * LaTeX: classes are now translatable using PO files
 * GUI: Widget based view of the questionnaire
 * LaTex report: Allow the generated LaTeX to be stored

New and updated translations:
 * German

Overview of Changes in SDAPS 1.0.3
==================================

Bugfix so that the SDAPS class works with older PGF versions.

Overview of Changes in SDAPS 1.0.2
==================================

Bugfix so that the commands work fine without a TTY.

Overview of Changes in SDAPS 1.0.1
==================================

Only depend on distutils and pkg_resources if doing a local run.

Overview of Changes in SDAPS 1.0.0
==================================

This is the first release of SDAPS. It is not fully compatible to older
versions. Anyone with existing projects should *not* upgrade.

Important changes:
 * LaTeX: Improved spacing
 * LaTeX: Fix position extraction code
 * LaTeX/core: Support for circular/elliptical checkboxes
 * LaTeX: now supports multicolumn layouts
 * LaTeX: new command to draw a filled checkbox

New and updated translations:
